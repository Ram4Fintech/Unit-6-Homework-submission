# Unit-6-Homework-submission
I have answered all the question in this Homework activity. I have summarised my steps here as follows:
Housing Rental Analysis for San Francisco:
i) Imported the csv data from the Resources file and read into a DataFrame;
ii) Calculated and plotted in a bar chart as well as by line plot, the housing units per year;
iii) Calculated and plotted the sale price per square foot and gross rent in San Francisco and also did an overlay plot line to show the relationship between the two variables. Also did a groupby function to do a drop down chart for each neighborhood to be visualised in terms of the two variables - sale per sqr foot and gross rent.
iv) Built an interactive neighborhood map with hvplot and Geoviews. For this purpose, I concatenated the two data frames all_neighborhoods_info_df and neighborhood_locations.df to create a an all_neighborhoods_df
v) In the end, I gave my interpretation of the data to give my opinion on the best startegy to invest in the area
